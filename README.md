Final Project WBS Sonar Singal
The Life-Cycle of End-To-End Machine Learning Project will be applied to develop/build the Rock-or-Mine prediction system of the submarine
For the development and building the Mine-Rock prediction system it should be collected the data/information of the related sensory system to learn the suggested machine learning system. This dataset is `Sonar` dataset, `which used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network . The task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.`\
The transmitted sonar signal is a frequency-modulated chirp, rising in frequency. The data set contains signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning 90 degrees for the cylinder and 180 degrees for the rock. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The integration aperture for higher frequencies occur later in time, since these frequencies are transmitted later during the chirp.
